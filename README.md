# Front-End Finds - A Bootstrap Experiment

This project is an experiment in using only Bootstrap with no custom CSS to build a basic Front-End Resource directory. The links are legit resources that I love and use.

This project used a super basic starter theme called [Bare](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/bare/)
